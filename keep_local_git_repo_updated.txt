Keeping the Local Repository Updated
If you have cloned the git repo (repository) locally using the "git" command, then you can also receive updates that the course staff might make. For example, we may add small bug fixes or improvements, as well as further examples. Here's how you can make sure you have the latest version.

First, if you have made changes to the example files that you want to keep, you should manually make a backup copy of these to another directory. (There are advanced git commands that can do something like this for you, but for now, it's easiest to make a backup copy of your work manually.)

Then, in the bash terminal, make sure you are in the coursera-cs400 directory where you have cloned the repo locally. The terminal commands below should be entered in the bash terminal one at a time. These commands will ensure you are on the main "master" branch, reset any changes you have made, and then pull the latest versions from the server:

git checkout master
git stash
git pull
